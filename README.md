This is my final project for an ethics class called "Ignorance, Lies, Hogwash, and Humbug." It is a simply survey hosted on a website to test people's willingness to accept information depending on the source. In this way it is an attempt to measure institutional bias. It is also a thorough experiment, as each participant is assigned a low, random score--completely unrelated to their responses--in attempt to promote self-reflection and intellectual humility.
